## What are Derivatives?

A **derivative** measures how a function changes as its input changes.

### Intuitive Understanding

Think of driving a car:





- Your position is a function of time: `position(t)`

- Your speed is the derivative of position: `speed = d(position)/dt`

- Speed tells you how fast your position is changing

If `x` goes from 3 to 4, does `f(x)`, that is `y`, change fast, eg. 6 to 40 or slower, eg. 6 to 7

**Derivative tells us the instantaneous rate of change of a function at any point.**

### Mathematical Definition

The derivative of `f(x)` at point `x` is:

```
f'(x) = lim[h→0] (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
```

Let's break down what each part means:

The derivative takes the average rate of change (slope) between two points, then makes the distance between those points infinitesimally small (h→0), giving us the instantaneous rate of change at exactly point `x`.

- **`f'(x)`** - This is the derivative of function `f` at point `x`. It tells us the instantaneous rate of change at that specific point.

- **`lim[h→0]`** - This is the "limit as h approaches 0". It means we're looking at what happens when `h` gets infinitely close to zero (but never actually equals zero). This is what makes it an *instantaneous* rate of change rather than an average.

- **`f(x+h)`** - This evaluates the function at a point slightly ahead of `x`. The `h` represents a tiny step forward from our current position `x`.

- **`f(x)`** - This evaluates the function at our current point `x`.

- **`f(x+h) - f(x)`** - This is the **change in the function's output** (the rise). It measures how much the function value changed as we moved from `x` to `x+h`.

- **`h`** - This is the **change in the input** (the run). It's the size of our step along the x-axis.

- **`(f(x+h) - f(x)) / h`** - This is the **average rate of change** over the interval from `x` to `x+h`. It's like calculating the slope of a line between two points: rise over run.

### Visual Representation



Here we have linearly growing function.

Derivative is always 3 for any `x` value, which means that in the original function, the rate of growth of `y` is 3 (if you increase `x` by 1, `y` will increase by 3, check it).

![Linear Function Derivative](/content/learn/math/derivatives/linear-function-derivative.png)

In the next image you can see that as `y` grows faster and faster in original function (square functions grow very fast).

Derivative shows this accelerating growth, you can notice that derivative is increasing (linearly) - which means the growth is accelerating.

![Quadratic Function Derivative](/content/learn/math/derivatives/quadratic-function-derivative.png)

In previous example derivative was always 3, which meant that function is always consistantly growing by 3.

Here, on the other hand, the growth is growing. 

## Common Derivative Rules

You will never calculate derivatives manually, but researcher needs to understand how it works.

### 1. Power Rule

If `f(x) = xⁿ`, then `f'(x) = nxⁿ⁻¹`

So just put the exponent in front of the variable (or multiply with the number in front) and reduce exponent by 1.

For `f(x) = x³`, derivative is `f'(x) = 3x²`

For `f(x) = 4x³`, derivative is `f'(x) = 4*3x² = 12x²`

#### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example 1:** `f(x) = x²`





- Using power rule: `f'(x) = 2x^(2-1) = 2x¹ = 2x`

- Verification: `f'(x) = 2x`

**Example 2:** `f(x) = x³`

- Using power rule: `f'(x) = 3x^(3-1) = 3x²`

- Verification: `f'(x) = 3x²`

**Example 3:** `f(x) = x⁴`

- Using power rule: `f'(x) = 4x^(4-1) = 4x³`

- Verification: `f'(x) = 4x³`

**Example 4:** `f(x) = √x = x^(1/2)`

- Using power rule: `f'(x) = (1/2)x^((1/2)-1) = (1/2)x^(-1/2) = 1/(2√x)`

- Verification: `f'(x) = 1/(2√x)`

**Example 5:** `f(x) = 1/x = x^(-1)`

- Using power rule: `f'(x) = (-1)x^(-1-1) = (-1)x^(-2) = -1/x²`

- Verification: `f'(x) = -1/x²`



### 2. Constant Multiple Rule

If `f(x) = c·g(x)`, then `f'(x) = c·g'(x)`

#### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example:** `f(x) = 5x²`

**Step 1:** Identify the constant and the function

- Constant: `c = 5`

- Function: `g(x) = x²`

**Step 2:** Find `g'(x)`

- `g'(x) = 2x` (using power rule)

**Step 3:** Apply constant multiple rule

- `f'(x) = c·g'(x) = 5·(2x) = 10x` - I showed this in the power rule as well.

**Verification:**

- `f(x) = 5x²`

- `f'(x) = 10x` ✓

**Example:** `f(x) = -3x³`

**Step 1:** Identify the constant and the function

- Constant: `c = -3`



- Function: `g(x) = x³`

**Step 2:** Find `g'(x)`

- `g'(x) = 3x²` (using power rule)

**Step 3:** Apply constant multiple rule

- `f'(x) = c·g'(x) = (-3)·(3x²) = -9x²`

**Verification:**

- `f(x) = -3x³`

- `f'(x) = -9x²` ✓



### 3. Sum Rule

If `f(x) = g(x) + h(x)`, then `f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)`

#### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example:** `f(x) = x² + 3x`

**Step 1:** Identify the functions

- `g(x) = x²`

- `h(x) = 3x`

**Step 2:** Find individual derivatives

**Step 3:** Apply sum rule

- `f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) = 2x + 3`

**Verification:**

- `f(x) = x² + 3x`

- `f'(x) = 2x + 3` ✓

**Example:** `f(x) = x³ + 2x² + 5x + 1`

**Step 1:** Identify the functions

- `g(x) = x³`

- `h(x) = 2x²`

- `i'(x) = 5` (constant multiple rule: 5·1 = 5)

- `j'(x) = 0` (constant rule)

**Step 3:** Apply sum rule

- `f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) + i'(x) + j'(x) = 3x² + 4x + 5 + 0 = 3x² + 4x + 5`

**Verification:**

- `f(x) = x³ + 2x² + 5x + 1`

- `f'(x) = 3x² + 4x + 5` ✓



### 4. Product Rule

If `f(x) = g(x)·h(x)`, then `f'(x) = g'(x)·h(x) + g(x)·h'(x)`

#### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example:** `f(x) = x²(x + 1)`

**Step 1:** Identify the functions

- `g(x) = x²`

- `h(x) = x + 1`

**Step 2:** Find individual derivatives

- `g'(x) = 2x` (power rule)

**Step 3:** Apply product rule

- `f'(x) = g'(x)·h(x) + g(x)·h'(x)`

- `f'(x) = (2x)·(x + 1) + (x²)·(1)`

- `f'(x) = 2x(x + 1) + x²`



- `f'(x) = 2x² + 2x + x²`

- `f'(x) = 3x² + 2x`

**Verification by expanding first:**

- `f(x) = x²(x + 1) = x³ + x²`

- `f'(x) = 3x² + 2x` ✓

**Example:** `f(x) = (2x + 3)(x² - 1)`

**Step 1:** Identify the functions

- `g(x) = 2x + 3`

- `h(x) = x² - 1`

- `f'(x) = 2(x² - 1) + (2x + 3)(2x)`

- `f'(x) = 2x² - 2 + 4x² + 6x`

- `f'(x) = 6x² + 6x - 2`



### 5. Chain Rule

If `f(x) = g(h(x))`, then `f'(x) = g'(h(x))·h'(x)`

#### Step-by-Step Examples

**Example:** `f(x) = (x² + 1)³`

**Step 1:** Identify the inner and outer functions

- Inner function: `h(x) = x² + 1`

- `f'(x) = 6x(x² + 1)²`

**Verification by expanding first:**

- `f(x) = (x² + 1)³ = (x² + 1)(x² + 1)(x² + 1)`

- Expanding: `f(x) = x⁶ + 3x⁴ + 3x² + 1`

- `f'(x) = 6x⁵ + 12x³ + 6x = 6x(x⁴ + 2x² + 1) = 6x(x² + 1)²` ✓

**Example:** `f(x) = √(x² + 4)`

**Step 1:** Identify the inner and outer functions

- Inner function: `h(x) = x² + 4`

- Outer function: `g(u) = √u = u^(1/2)` (where `u = h(x)`)

## Derivatives of Neural Network Functions

### 1. Sigmoid Function

![Sigmoid Formula](/content/learn/math/derivatives/sigmoid-formula.png)

```
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```

#### Step-by-Step Derivative Calculation

Usually you will ChatGPT sigmoid derivative, but let's see how it's derived.

To find the derivative of sigmoid, we'll use the quotient rule and chain rule.

**Step 1:** Rewrite the function

- `f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))`

- Let `u = 1 + e^(-x)`, so `f(x) = 1/u`

**Step 2:** Apply quotient rule

- `f'(x) = (0·u - 1·u') / u² = -u' / u²`

**Step 3:** Find `u'` using chain rule

- `u = 1 + e^(-x)`

- `u' = 0 + e^(-x) · (-1) = -e^(-x)`

**Step 4:** Substitute back

- `f'(x) = -(-e^(-x)) / (1 + e^(-x))²`

- `f'(x) = e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x))²`

**Step 5:** Simplify

- `f'(x) = e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x))²`

- `f'(x) = [e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x))] · [1 / (1 + e^(-x))]`

- `f'(x) = [1 / (1 + e^(-x))] · [e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x))]`

- `f'(x) = f(x) · [e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x))]`

**Step 6:** Further simplification

- Notice that `e^(-x) / (1 + e^(-x)) = 1 - 1/(1 + e^(-x)) = 1 - f(x)`

- Therefore: `f'(x) = f(x) · (1 - f(x))`

**Final Result:** `f'(x) = f(x)(1 - f(x))`

## Chain Rule

Chain rule is how neural networks learn (backpropagation).

### Mathematical Statement

If `y = f(g(x))`, then `dy/dx = (dy/dg) × (dg/dx)`

### Neural Network Application

In neural networks, we often have functions like: `f(x) = activation(linear_transformation(x))`

### Step-by-Step Chain Rule Example

**Example:** Neural Network Layer with Sigmoid Activation

**Given:**

- Linear transformation: `z = 2x + 1`

- Activation function: `σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))`

- Composite function: `f(x) = σ(2x + 1)`

**Step 1:** Identify inner and outer functions

- Inner function: `h(x) = 2x + 1`

- Outer function: `g(z) = σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))`

**Step 2:** Find individual derivatives

- `h'(x) = 2` (derivative of 2x + 1)

- `g'(z) = σ(z)(1 - σ(z))` (sigmoid derivative)

**Step 3:** Apply chain rule

- `f'(x) = g'(h(x)) · h'(x)`

- `f'(x) = σ(2x + 1)(1 - σ(2x + 1)) · 2`

- `f'(x) = 2σ(2x + 1)(1 - σ(2x + 1))`

**Step 4:** Calculate at specific point `(x = 1)`

**Step 4a:** Calculate `h(1)`

- `h(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3`

**Step 4b:** Calculate `σ(3)`





- `σ(3) = 1/(1 + e^(-3)) = 1/(1 + 0.050) = 1/1.050 ≈ 0.953`

**Step 4c:** Calculate `σ'(3)`

- `σ'(3) = σ(3)(1 - σ(3)) = 0.953(1 - 0.953) = 0.953(0.047) ≈ 0.045`

**Step 4d:** Apply chain rule

- `f'(1) = σ'(3) · h'(1) = 0.045 · 2 = 0.090`

**Final Answer:** `f'(1) ≈ 0.090`

---

## Partial Derivatives

When we have functions of multiple variables, we use **partial derivatives**.

### Definition

For `f(x, y)`, the partial derivative with respect to `x` is: 
```
∂f/∂x = lim[h→0] (f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)) / h
```

### Example: Linear Function

`f(x, y) = 2x + 3y + 1`

#### Step-by-Step Partial Derivative Calculation

**Finding ∂f/∂x (partial derivative with respect to x):**

**Step 1:** Treat `y` as a constant

- `f(x, y) = 2x + 3y + 1`

- When taking ∂f/∂x, we treat `y` as constant, so `3y + 1` is constant

**Step 2:** Differentiate with respect to `x`

- `∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(2x) + ∂/∂x(3y) + ∂/∂x(1)`

- `∂f/∂x = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`

**Finding ∂f/∂y (partial derivative with respect to y):**

**Step 1:** Treat `x` as a constant

- `f(x, y) = 2x + 3y + 1`

- When taking ∂f/∂y, we treat `x` as constant, so `2x + 1` is constant

**Step 2:** Differentiate with respect to `y`

- `∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(2x) + ∂/∂y(3y) + ∂/∂y(1)`

- `∂f/∂y = 0 + 3 + 0 = 3`

**Final Results:**

- `∂f/∂x = 2`

- `∂f/∂y = 3`

#### Hand Calculation Examples

**Example:** Find partial derivatives at `(x, y) = (1, 2)`

- `∂f/∂x = 2` (constant, doesn't depend on x or y)

- `∂f/∂y = 3` (constant, doesn't depend on x or y)

**Example:** Find partial derivatives at `(x, y) = (5, -1)`

- `∂f/∂x = 2` (still constant)

- `∂f/∂y = 3` (still constant)



### Example: Quadratic Function

- When taking ∂f/∂x, we treat `y` as constant

**Step 2:** Differentiate with respect to `x`

- `∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x(x²) + ∂/∂x(2xy) + ∂/∂x(y²)`

- `∂f/∂x = 2x + 2y + 0 = 2x + 2y`

**Finding ∂f/∂y (partial derivative with respect to y):**

**Step 1:** Treat `x` as a constant

- `f(x, y) = x² + 2xy + y²`

- When taking ∂f/∂y, we treat `x` as constant

**Step 2:** Differentiate with respect to `y`

- `∂f/∂y = ∂/∂y(x²) + ∂/∂y(2xy) + ∂/∂y(y²)`

- `∂f/∂y = 0 + 2x + 2y = 2x + 2y`

**Final Results:**

- `∂f/∂x = 2x + 2y`

- `∂f/∂y = 2x + 2y`

#### Hand Calculation Examples

**Example:** Find partial derivatives at `(x, y) = (1, 2)`

**Step 1:** Calculate ∂f/∂x

- `∂f/∂x = 2(1) + 2(2) = 2 + 4 = 6`

**Step 2:** Calculate ∂f/∂y

- `∂f/∂y = 2(1) + 2(2) = 2 + 4 = 6`

**Example:** Find partial derivatives at `(x, y) = (3, -1)`

**Step 1:** Calculate ∂f/∂x

- `∂f/∂x = 2(3) + 2(-1) = 6 - 2 = 4`

**Step 2:** Calculate ∂f/∂y





- `∂f/∂y = 2(3) + 2(-1) = 6 - 2 = 4`
